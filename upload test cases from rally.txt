Step 1: Navigate to Quality >> Test Cases

Step 2: Select “Actions” >> click on “Import Test Cases…” link

You will get a window where you can see a link called “import template”

Step 3: Click on “import template” and download the excel template and provide data as shown in the image below and save in your hard drive.

Add object Type as “Test Case” and provide the details. Here, only Object Type and Name are only two mandatory fields and 
remaining other columns we can add if we want to provide those details and import it to Rally.

As we have to import test steps also, for that provide step details with Object Type as “Test Case Step” and provide 
index as step number and test case line number in Test Case column like line[2] for first test case as shown below to map
 test steps to a specific test case. Likewise, add as many test cases you want details of and save the data.
 
 Step 4: Browse the file from the import window and click on the “Validate” button to check for any errors.

Step 5: Once the validation is successful, a window will appear with the Import button.

Once the import is successful, it will show Import successful message. Close the window.

You can open the Quality >> Test Cases page and verify the new test cases added. Also, you can check by searching the Work Product
 (User Story) and verify if the test cases are associated with it as per the data provided.

Apart from the above process, we can also install Excel Rally add-in and connect to Rally from the excel and export the test cases to Rally.
